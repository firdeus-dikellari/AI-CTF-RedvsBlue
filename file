Now I want to upload everything on github, but prepare the gitignore to exclude node modules, don't forget to add one requriements.txt on  C:\Users\firdeus\Desktop\CTF with all python dependencies that need to be installed. As well as anaconda env creation.

Include also .env files on github repo, since they don't have any confidential data.





You are a full-stack developer tasked with creating a simple Capture The Flag (CTF) web app for AI security challenges.

Requirements:

The app has a clean UI showing challenge categories (e.g., Prompt Injection, Data Poisoning, Secure System Prompt, Logging, etc).
Under each category, list individual challenges by title.
When a user clicks a challenge, load a challenge page with:

Challenge description
An input form to send queries to an AI backend
Display AI responses live
Flag reveal logic triggered when AI outputs certain keywords or conditions based on the challenge

The backend must:

Expose API endpoints that accept user queries and the selected challenge ID
Dynamically load the correct system prompt and challenge logic based on challenge ID
Query the AI model (e.g., via Ollama API) with the appropriate prompt and user input
Analyze AI output for flag reveal conditions and respond accordingly
No user accounts, scoring, or persistence needed â€” stateless request-response only
Do not dockerize at this stage; focus on working code that runs locally

Please generate:

A React frontend skeleton with components for category list, challenge list, and challenge interface
A Node.js/Express backend skeleton with routes for fetching challenge metadata and processing queries
A sample challenges data structure (JSON or JS object) listing categories, challenges, descriptions, and system prompts
Basic flag detection logic example in the backend for one challenge

Make sure the code is clean, well-commented, and modular for easy extension with more challenges.




###Dockerization


You are a DevOps engineer tasked with containerizing a simple AI security CTF web app consisting of:
A React frontend showing challenge categories and individual challenge pages
A Node.js/Express backend serving challenge data and querying the AI model via Ollama API

Requirements:

Write Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend services, optimized for local development and production.

Create a docker-compose.yml that:

Builds and runs the frontend and backend containers
Connects them on a shared network
Exposes necessary ports (e.g., 3000 frontend, 5000 backend)
Assume the user has Ollama installed locally (https://ollama.ai) and has pulled the gemma3.1b model via ollama pull gemma3.1b.
The backend container should connect to the local Ollama API running on the host machine. Provide instructions or configuration so the backend inside the container can access localhost:11434 on the host (using Docker networking tricks like host.docker.internal or alternatives for Linux).
Provide simple, clear instructions in README snippets for the user on:
Installing Ollama and pulling gemma3.1b
Building and running the Docker containers (docker-compose up --build)
Accessing the app via browser
Keep the setup minimal, so a user with Ollama and the pulled model can get started quickly without complex config.

Please generate:

Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
docker-compose.yml with service definitions and networking config
Relevant backend code/config adjustments for Ollama host connectivity
README instructions snippet for running the full stack with Ollama locally
Make sure the docker setup is developer-friendly and suitable for local AI model integration.
