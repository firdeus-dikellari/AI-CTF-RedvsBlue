You are a developer creating a utility to obfuscate CTF flags using XOR cipher for secure storage.

Requirements:
Write two functions: one to XOR-encode a flag string with a given key, and one to decode it back.
The encoded output should be a hex string (for easy storage in JSON or code).
Provide implementations in both Python and Node.js.
Include example usage showing how to encode a flag and then decode it back.
Write clean, well-commented, and reusable code.
Make sure the decode function perfectly reverses the encode function with the same key.
Please provide the full code for both languages.
